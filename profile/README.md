# Synthetic Biology Data Exchange Group

A group to coordinate the development of standards to facilitate data exchange in synthetic biology

As well as several software projects, this organization includes respositories containing information about the SBOL/SBOL Visual standards and their development.


[SbolStandardWebsite](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SbolStandardWebsite) is the repo from which [http://www.sbolstandard.org/](http://www.sbolstandard.org/) is generated.


A summary of recent activity on the specification (rather than software) repos within the SynBioDex organization is generated by [SynBioDex/activity-summaries](https://github.com/SynBioDex/activity-summaries) and accessible at: https://synbiodex.github.io/activity-summaries/


### SBOL
* [SBOL-specification](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-specification): the SBOL Standard
* [SEPs](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs): SBOL Enhancement Proposals - proposals for changes to the SBOL standard 

### SBOL Visual
* [SBOL-visual](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual): the SBOL Visual standard
* [sbol-visual-ontology](https://github.com/SynBioDex/sbol-visual-ontology): onotology generated from the SBOL visual standard

### SBOL and SBOL Visual
* [SBOL-examples](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-examples): examples and best practices for using SBOL and SBOL Visual
* [Community-Media](https://github.com/SynBioDex/Community-Media): publicly presented papers, posters, and talks that have been given on SBOL
* [SBOL-Editors](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Editors): minutes of the editors' meetings recorded [as GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Editors/discussions)
* [SBOL-Industrial-Summer-Program](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Industrial-Summer-Program): tracker for project ideas for the student summer program
