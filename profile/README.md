# Synthetic Biology Data Exchange Group

A group to coordinate the development of standards to facilitate data exchange in synthetic biology

As well as several software projects, this organization includes respositories containing information about the SBOL/SBOL Visual standards and their development.


[SbolStandardWebsite](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SbolStandardWebsite) is the repo from which [http://www.sbolstandard.org/](http://www.sbolstandard.org/) is generated.

### SBOL
* [SBOL-specification](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-specification): the SBOL Standard

### SBOL Visual
* [SBOL-visual](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual): the SBOL Visual standard
* [sbol-visual-ontology](https://github.com/SynBioDex/sbol-visual-ontology): onotology generated from the SBOL visual standard

### SBOL and SBOL Visual
* [SBOL-examples](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-examples): examples and best practices for using SBOL and SBOL Visual
* [Community-Media](https://github.com/SynBioDex/Community-Media): publicly presented papers, posters, and talks that have been given on SBOL
* [SBOL-Editors](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-Editors): minutes of the editors' meetings recorded as GitHub Discussions
